# Indoor Ski App

Click **[here](#)** to see the deployed version :woman_technologist:

## Intro

Hi! :raising_hand_woman: My name is Willemijn, and this is my **portfolio project**. With a background in growth marketing and a love for snowboarding, I've created an app to find indoor ski places in the Netherlands to like and share with your friends :snowboarder:

I will explain more about the app, the technologies, and frameworks I used below, as well as my goals for this project and how I got super excited about **Next.js** and **Server Side Rendering** :pray:


> **Note:** The Indoor Ski App is an MVP, not a final version. I implemented the most important features, [other ones](https://github.com/users/wmw123/projects/1) will be added in the future.

## About The App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Goals of this project

Besides practicing full-stack development as I learned in the bootcamp, the main focus was to get familiar with Server Side Rendering for SEO purposes. 

## Technologies

Front End
- Node.js
- React
- Next
- Redux
- Axios
- SWR
- CSS

Back End
- Express
- REST
- Sequelize
- Postgres

## Project user stories and wireframe

The [user stories](https://github.com/users/wmw123/projects/1) and [wireframe](https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/editor.jsp?editor=off&publicid=M543efa729e4ff905c8c5b40b2a70e7f51593516357223&projectid=Mda3dd313d0f68cc47566c71e932ab5bb1593509887788&perm=Owner#/page/Dd30856273744636cab55309ae806476e) I used to plan my project.

## Server repository

The repository for the backend can be found [here](https://github.com/wmw123/indoor-ski-app-backend). This is a RESTful API using Express.js. The database is built using Postgres. [Here](https://app.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/a232dde1-637e-44fb-8b59-b4c153413f0b) is the data model. Object-relational mapping is done using Sequelize

## Client repository

To run the development server, you can run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

If you want to check out wich pages are created on build time, try:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Learn more about Next.js

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

## Other usefull sources

Because Next.js and it's new hooks getStaticProps and getStaticPaths were new to me - and are very new in general - these sources were really helpful for me (and hopefully for you too!):

- [Next.js tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3WM11AQgjw&list=PL0JUJlOCq7oxNv16mSGhMMPwzM00UmI4K)
